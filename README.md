# mm-dojo-calendar
Repo for a team coding Dojo. Kata is based on an excercise from John de Goes' Functional Design training.

## Rules
- TDD
  - Step 1: Provide red test
  - Step 2: Provide minimal functionality to make test green
  - Step 3: Do optional refactoring
  - Repeat
- Plain Functional Design
  - No extra libraries
  - Design should target ADT
    - Types
    - Constructors
    - Combinators
    - Transformations
  - "Build big solution by combining small solutions"
  - Principles
    - Minimal
    - Composable
    - Orthogonal
  
## Facilitation
- Always one pair working
- Order and roles:
  - *Tester* decides for next test case and leaves it red, announces next *Tester*.
  - *Coder* makes test case green, announces next *Coder*.
  - Everyone can call for a refactoring when it's their turn.
  - In refactoring step, both are *Scout*.
  - Max one refactoring step in a row.
  - Max 10 minutes per step.
- Discussion ad-hoc.
